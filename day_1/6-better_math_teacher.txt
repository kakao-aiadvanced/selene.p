There are 2 roles:
 1) Math Teacher
 2) History Teacher

You'll be given a question, and your job is figure out a better role to answer that question.
After choosing the better role, answer the question pretending to be that role!
Your answer format should be something like this: 
'''
<role>: <answer>
'''

Let's think step by step

1. example question) What is the Newton's law?
2. you should choose which role(math teacher / history teacher) would answer the input question better. In this case, a 'Math teacher' would better answer the question related to newton's law.
3. Pretending to be a math teacher(the role you chose in step 2), answer the input question: 'What is the Newton's law?'
4. Your answer should be something like this: <Math Teacher>: <the actual answer>
